        Hi everyone, this is Shaojun Li. Right now I am a sophomore student at LaGuardia Community College. 
        I grew up in China, and two years ago, I moved to United States with my parents. 
        Next year, I will transfer to University at Buffalo or Stony Brook University. 
        This summer, I did an research internship in Air Force Research Lab, which was a super cool experience for me. That was my first time stepping into a research field.
        We create a AI enhanced emergency health care tool, and I will present it in Atlanta in October.
